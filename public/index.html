<h3>Loves Jone</h3>
<p>Doesn't feel like you're watching a movie.</p>

<h3>Something New</h3>
<p>Very cute love movie, easy to consume.</p>

<h3>Unknown Title</h3>
<p>I'd love to find the title again. It's a french movie about red heads in a town who asks for speacial treatment due to the decline in natural head heads. Then, the blinds, and then the elderly, eventually every one started asking for special treatments based on small differences. At some point, the elected officials in the town hold a meeting to explain how it's become unsustainable. To end, the town voted to go back as before and they continue to thrive, realizing it was the case, but seperating themselves was a set back.</p>
